Data Science Automation



This project uses auto ml to predict churn from a new dataset. First it reads in preprocessed test data and uses paycaret to find the best autoML model for making predictions. Then it uses that model to read in a new dataset, that most be identically preprocessed, to predict churn.



A virtual environment with a downgraded version of Python 3.11.9 is required to run the program. 



The .py file is not returning results and needs to be debugged.
